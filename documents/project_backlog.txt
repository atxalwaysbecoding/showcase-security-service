Todo
Done - Add spring security
Done - Add healthcheck API (/health)
Done - Create an App JWT request API (no credentials required)
Done - Create a set of user credentials (in memory)
Done - Update App JWT request API to require user credentials (i.e. /login, /encodePassword, and /secure)
In Progress - Create and assign various user properties (roles/authorities)
- Create a set of APIs that require various user JWT roles
- Expose administrative APIs to manage user credentials and user properties (roles)

Other:
Done - Add global exception handling

Bug/Concern:
- On a second login, unauthorized error happens because pw is null seemingly because of User.eraseCredentials() call.

## About the 'showcase-security-service' project

The purpose of this project is to showcase some of my github repository work with Spring Boot by developing a simple security service that distributes JWTs for API authorization.
Some of the goals I hope to accomplish with this project include:

1. Demonstrate practical usage of JWTs as well as the administrative functions accompanied with managing different user credentials and roles
2. Offer a working example of all the below stated concepts and capabilities working side-by-side
3. Push past my imposter syndrome and practice what I know

Intended concepts and key capabilities showcased:
* Generate and validate a JWT token using spring 2.3.1
* Authenticate all APIs except /login used to generate a Bearer Token
* Create an in-memory users and attempts table for user and login attempts tracking

Note the ./documents/project_backlog.txt file capturing future todo items.
